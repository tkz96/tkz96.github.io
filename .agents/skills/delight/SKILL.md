name: delight
description: "Delight pass — adds one or two memorable micro-interactions (copy specificity, hover choreography, state transitions, one signature detail) without decoration or confetti. Use when the UI works but feels generic, or when the user says "make it feel special" / "add some personality". Invoke when the user asks for delight on their UI, or mentions 'delight' alongside design / UI / frontend work."

**Context:** this sub-skill is one lens of the broader `ui-craft` skill. If the `ui-craft` skill is also installed, read its SKILL.md first for Discovery + Anti-Slop + Craft Test, then apply the specific lens below.

Add delight to the UI at the target the user described. Load the `ui-craft` skill.

**Delight is specificity, not decoration.** The goal is one or two moments a user would screenshot — not confetti, not bounce, not emoji.

**Candidates, ordered by safety (start at the top):**

1. **Copy specificity** — confirmation toasts name the thing ("3 members invited — Alex, Sam, Jordan", not "Invites sent"). Empty states with wit but no cringe ("Nothing here yet — add your first project" > "Oops! Looks like it's empty 😅").
2. **Hover choreography** — multi-property hover (transform + color + shadow) that moves together on one shared duration/easing. One card, not every card.
3. **State transitions** — optimistic UI + tiny success micro-animation (checkmark stroke draw, count-up on a number, subtle scale-and-settle on the updated row).
4. **One signature detail** — custom list markers tied to the domain, asymmetric column offset on a single section, scroll-linked progress that tracks something real (reading progress, form completion).

**Never add:**
- Bounce easing (`cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.27, 1.55)`) — flagged in anti-slop.
- Confetti on mundane actions (file saved, field updated).
- Emoji spam or "🎉 SUCCESS!" in ALL CAPS.
- Idle float/bob/shimmer on elements that aren't waiting for anything.

**Knob gating (MOTION_INTENSITY):**
- `≤ 3` → copy-only delight. No animated delight. Candidate 1 only.
- `4-7` → copy + hover + state transitions (candidates 1-3).
- `8+` → all four, including the signature detail.

**Output**: edit code directly. Print the Review Format table. Flag every candidate you chose not to add and why.
