# Design Brief

Defines the format of `.ui-craft/brief.md` — the durable artifact that anchors every design decision in this project. Read it first when working on any UI task. If it doesn't exist, run `/brief` to generate one. Every decision you make should be traceable to a principle in the brief.

---

## The Brief Format

The brief is a single markdown file at `.ui-craft/brief.md`. Five required sections, all short, plus an optional sixth that grows over time. No preamble. No mission statements.

---

### 1. Product purpose (1 sentence)

What this product does, in one sentence. Not a tagline. Specific. The kind of sentence a stranger could repeat after reading once.

> **Strong:** "Schedules end-of-day cash reconciliation reports for retail finance teams."
> **Weak:** "An AI-powered platform for modern teams." — generic, interchangeable with any SaaS product, tells the agent nothing about what trade-offs to make.

The test: could two different products use this sentence? If yes, rewrite.

---

### 2. Primary user (1 sentence)

Who the product is for, by role and context. Specific enough that a UI decision could differ from a hypothetical secondary user.

> **Strong:** "A finance ops lead at a 200-store retail chain, working in the office between 6am and 9am, on a 13" laptop."
> **Weak:** "Anyone who manages money." — too broad to constrain a single layout decision.

Role + context + device is the minimum. Frequency of use and session length are useful additions.

---

### 3. Three to five principles (the operating beliefs)

Opinionated statements about how this product behaves. Not aspirations — beliefs. Beliefs that, when two conflict, one wins.

Each principle must clear five bars:

- **Opinionated** — takes a stance someone could disagree with
- **Actionable** — resolves a real design debate when applied
- **Memorable** — short enough to recall without reading the file
- **Distinctive** — reflects this product, not generic SaaS values
- **Testable** — a proposed design can be evaluated against it

List them in conflict-resolution order. When two principles apply to the same decision, the higher one wins.

**Example pairs — strong vs. weak:**

| Strong | Weak | Why the weak one fails |
|--------|------|----------------------|
| "Wrong is worse than late." | "Accuracy matters." | The strong one resolves the confirmation modal debate. The weak one is a platitude every product claims. |
| "The empty page is the customer." | "Good onboarding is important." | The strong one makes a specific architectural call: blank canvas over wizard. The weak one is a category. |
| "Show the data, not the design." | "Keep it simple." | The strong one tells the agent what to do with color, chrome, and decoration. The weak one means nothing actionable. |

---

### 4. Success metric for the surface (1-2 sentences)

What "the user succeeded" looks like, in observable behavior. Not a business metric — a usage signal that surface design directly influences.

> **Strong:** "User identifies the day's outlier stores within 30 seconds of landing on the dashboard."
> **Weak:** "Increase MRR by 12%." — a business outcome; the surface has no direct lever on it.

The metric constrains every information hierarchy decision on that surface. Write it before designing the layout.

---

### 5. Out of scope (bullet list)

Three to five things this surface deliberately does NOT do. Constrain by exclusion. Prevents scope creep mid-design.

```markdown
- Does not display historical trends beyond 30 days
- Does not support bulk edits from this surface
- Does not expose raw transaction data
```

Short. Declarative. Each item should prevent at least one future feature request from landing in the wrong place.

---

### 6. Learned constraints (optional, append-only)

Corrections the user has made to design output on this project — the brief teaching itself. Starts empty; grows whenever the user rejects or redirects a choice. Each entry is dated and pins the rule plus the reason, so it generalizes instead of pattern-matching one literal case.

```markdown
- **2026-06-23** — No gradient backgrounds on hero/landing surfaces. *Why:* brand reads restrained; flashy undercuts trust.
- **2026-06-20** — Button press feedback caps at `scale(0.97)`. *Why:* user found 0.92 exaggerated.
```

These are project-scoped design facts, not a general memory store — they live in the brief because they *are* design decisions, just learned rather than stated up front. They rank with the principles (section 3): a learned constraint overrides a skill default but never the accessibility/correctness floor.

---

## How the Brief Gets Used

Read `.ui-craft/brief.md` first when working on any UI. It is Discovery Phase Step 1.

When making a design decision, cite the principle it applies. Write it as: *"Density reduced per principle 2: 'Show the data, not the design.'"* If a decision isn't covered by any principle, flag it — the brief is incomplete, not the decision wrong. Surface the gap so the brief can be updated.

If two principles conflict, the higher-ranked one wins. Document the override.

---

## Principles Workshop

Run this when the user is starting fresh and has no principles yet.

**Step 1: Start from product values, not visual style.**
Visual style is a consequence of values. "Clean and minimal" is not a principle — it's an aesthetic preference. Ask: what does this product believe about its users' time, expertise, errors, and goals?

**Step 2: Apply the "would anyone disagree?" test.**
If every reasonable person would agree with the principle, it's a platitude. "Be accessible to all users" fails this test. "Speed over completeness — truncate everything, reveal on demand" passes it because some would argue against it.

**Step 3: Test against past decisions.**
Take three real design calls that were debated. Would the candidate principle have produced the same outcome? If it would have flipped a decision you're happy with, it's the wrong principle.

**Step 4: Rank for conflict.**
When "speed" and "completeness" both apply to the same decision, which wins? Write the ranking explicitly. Unranked principles defer every close call back to a human — which defeats the purpose.

**Step 5: Trim to three to five.**
More than five means none of them are load-bearing. If you have eight, find the two that subsume the others and keep those. A principle that never resolves a debate is decorative.

**Examples by product archetype:**

- Finance reconciliation tool: "Wrong is worse than late." Makes confirmation modals universal. Makes fast-paths expensive to justify. Prevents destructive actions from hiding behind affordance.
- Creative tool: "The empty page is the customer." Makes loading states cheaper than first-run wizards. Makes templates less prominent than blank-canvas affordance. Deprioritizes onboarding over invitations.
- Developer dashboard: "Show the data, not the design." Retreats chrome. Reserves color for status signals. Blocks marketing-page patterns from leaking into the product.

## When to Update the Brief

Update when any of these shift: product direction, target user definition, surface scope, or a principle is found to resolve decisions in the wrong direction.

Date each addition. Never delete past principles — if a principle is superseded, mark it deprecated with the date and a reason:

```markdown
~~3. "Speed over completeness."~~ — deprecated 2025-11, product shifted to compliance use case where error cost > latency cost.
4. "Correctness over speed."
```

The brief is append-mostly. The team should be able to trace why a principle changed.

---

## Self-Correction

When the user corrects design output — "no así", "no me gusta", "always do X here", "never Z", or reverses a non-default choice in a way that reads as a standing preference — append it to section 6 (run `/remember`). Capture the **why**, not just the what; phrase it so a future build can apply it without this conversation's context; confirm in one line where it landed. Don't re-litigate a correction already recorded. If a correction would breach the accessibility/correctness floor, apply the closest compliant interpretation and say so — never store an unsafe rule.

This is project-scoped, and it lives in the brief by design — ui-craft is a UI skill, not a general memory engine.

**Optional cross-project bridge.** If the user wants a correction applied across *all* their projects (not just this one), that's general memory, outside the brief's scope. When an external memory service is available to the agent, mirror the constraint there so other projects inherit it; otherwise note that cross-project recall needs such a service. The brief remains the canonical project store either way.

---

## When the Brief Doesn't Apply

**Marketing pages** need a different brief than the product itself. The primary user, success metric, and principles are different. Write a separate brief scoped to the marketing surface.

**First-run experiences** often have a distinct goal (activation, not task completion) and may warrant their own brief — or an addendum to the product brief.

**Multi-brand products** need a brief per brand, not per product. The format is the same; the content differs per brand context.

The brief format is universal. Its content is always scoped to a single surface and audience. If one brief is trying to serve three different contexts, split it.

## File Location and Git

Commit `.ui-craft/brief.md` to the repo. The brief is documentation, not configuration. Ignoring it in `.gitignore` means losing the team's collective design memory between sessions and collaborators.

The `.ui-craft/` directory is the project's design decision store. It belongs in version control alongside the code it governs.
