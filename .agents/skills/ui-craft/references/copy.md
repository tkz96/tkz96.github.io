# UX Copy & Writing

Voice, tone, reading level, terminology, inclusive language, locale handling, and tactical microcopy (errors, empty states, CTAs). Clear, human interface writing.

---

## Voice vs Tone

**Voice is constant. Tone varies.** Voice is the product's personality — how it sounds whether you're reading onboarding, an error, or a paywall. Tone is how that voice adjusts to context: warmer in onboarding, restrained in success, explicit in destructive confirms. A product with a consistent voice but responsive tone reads as designed; a product with shifting voice reads as written by 12 people.

### Voice Matrix

Pick three axes. Lock a position on each. Deviations are deliberate (brand campaigns, April Fools), never accidental.

| Axis | Endpoints | What to lock down |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Formality | Formal ↔ Casual | Pick a position; document with one sample sentence at the chosen point and one at each extreme |
| Reverence | Reverent ↔ Irreverent | Reverent treats the user task as serious; irreverent allows wit and acknowledges absurdity. Pick one. |
| Expertise | Expert ↔ Beginner-friendly | Expert assumes vocabulary; beginner-friendly defines on first use. Mixed within a product is acceptable when the surfaces serve different audiences. |

Document the positions. "Casual-but-respectful, beginner-friendly, mildly irreverent" is a brief a writer can execute against. "Friendly" is not.

### Tone by Context

Voice is fixed; tone moves along these contexts. Each row below assumes a default voice of "casual-professional, beginner-friendly, restrained."

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onboarding | Warm + specific | "Let's get your first project in. Takes 60 seconds." |
| Error — user-recoverable | Honest + actionable | "We couldn't save your draft. Retry, or copy the error for support: `abc-123`." |
| Error — system outage | Honest + transparent | "Search is down. We're investigating. Your data is safe." |
| Success | Restrained | "Changes saved." — not "Amazing work!" |
| Destructive confirm | Explicit about consequences | "Delete 3 items? You'll have 30 days to restore them from Trash." |
| Empty state | Action-oriented | "No integrations yet. Connect Slack, GitHub, or Linear to get started." |
| Paywall / limit | Informational, not shaming | "You're at 5/5 free projects. Upgrade to create more." |
| Danger zone (settings) | Neutral + precise | "Deleting the workspace removes all 47 projects and invalidates all API keys." |
| Waiting / latency | Honest about duration | "Generating report. Usually 20-40 seconds." |

**Never:** exclamation points on errors. Emoji in enterprise contexts. Celebratory copy on routine saves.

## Reading Level

Target ~8th-grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid ~70+, grade ~8). Rules of thumb:

- Sentences ≤ 20 words.
- Paragraphs ≤ 3 sentences.
- Concrete nouns over abstractions ("invoice" beats "billing artifact").
- Active voice ("You signed in" beats "Sign-in was completed").
- One idea per sentence.
- **Front-load.** The key word or fact opens the sentence, heading, and notification — readers and screen-reader users decide whether to continue from the first words. Inverted pyramid for blocks: conclusion → support → background.
- **Abbreviations are a tax.** Spell terms out; if an acronym must repeat, define it on first use ("estimated arrival (ETA)") and stay consistent after.

**Example rewrite:**

| Before (grade 14) | After (grade 7) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Upon successful authentication, users will be redirected to their personalized dashboard interface." | "You'll see your dashboard after you sign in." |
| "In the event that the operation is unsuccessful, please re-attempt the transmission." | "If it fails, try again." |
| "Configuration modifications will be persisted upon form submission." | "Your changes save when you click Save." |

Automate: [hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com/) for spot checks; the [`flesch` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flesch) for build-time linting. `write-good` (npm) flags weasel words, passive voice, lexical illusions. `alex` (npm) is an inclusive-language linter.

## Terminology Consistency

Every product needs a glossary. Same concept → same word, everywhere.

**Common pitfalls:**
- `user` / `member` / `account` / `seat` — pick one per concept and stick.
- `project` / `workspace` / `board` — pick one per level of hierarchy.
- `delete` / `remove` / `archive` / `trash` — these mean different things; don't alias.
- `sign in` / `log in` — both are standard; pick one and never mix.
- `save` / `publish` / `update` — same action under three names in three surfaces is a finding.

**Red flag:** in a review, grep the codebase for every verb on every button. If `Save` / `Update` / `Apply` appear on forms that do the same thing, file it.

---

## Inclusive Language

Swap the loaded term for the neutral one. Keep the list tight — don't moralize, just fix.

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| blacklist / whitelist | blocklist / allowlist |
| master / slave | primary / replica |
| sanity check | quick check |
| grandfathered | legacy |
| he / she (generic) | they |
| manhours / manpower | work hours / team capacity |
| man-in-the-middle | on-path attack |
| dummy value | placeholder value |
| first-class citizen | fully supported |

Don't soften to the point of vagueness — "on-path attack" is still precise; "bad thing happens in network" is not.

---

## Locale-Aware Strings

Rules agents routinely ignore. Every one is shippable to production the day the product adds a second locale.

- **Dates.** `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, options)`. Never hardcode `MM/DD/YYYY` unless the audience is exclusively US. Use `new Date().toLocaleDateString(locale, { dateStyle: 'medium' })` for user-facing dates.
- **Numbers and currency.** `Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency })`. Decimal and thousands separators differ: `1,234.56` (US) vs `1.234,56` (DE) vs `1 234,56` (FR).
- **Plurals.** `Intl.PluralRules(locale)`. English has 2 forms; Russian has 3; Arabic has 6. Never `n === 1 ? "1 item" : n + " items"` — breaks in Polish, Arabic, Welsh.
- **Length tolerance.** German ≈ 1.3× English; Russian ≈ 1.2×; Chinese ≈ 0.5×. Don't fix widths to English copy. Test with `de-DE` pseudo-locale.
- **RTL readiness.** Use logical CSS properties (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `border-inline-start`), not `margin-left`. `dir="rtl"` at the root should flip the UI without additional CSS.
- **Time zones.** Store UTC, display in the user's zone. Never assume server time is user time. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, { timeZone })`.
- **Sorting.** `Intl.Collator(locale)` — alphabetical order is locale-dependent (Swedish sorts `å` after `z`, German doesn't).

---

## Core Principles (Tactical)

1. **Be specific**: "Enter email" not "Enter value"
2. **Be concise**: Cut unnecessary words (don't sacrifice clarity)
3. **Be active**: "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
4. **Be human**: "Something went wrong" not "System error encountered"
5. **Be helpful**: Tell users what to do, not just what happened
6. **Be consistent**: Same terms throughout — don't vary for variety

---

## CTAs & Buttons

**Verb + noun.** Never `Submit`, `OK`, `Click here`, `Continue`.

| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| Submit | Create project |
| OK | Got it |
| Continue | Next: billing |
| Click here | Download invoice (PDF, 84KB) |
| Delete | Delete workspace |

- Describe the action specifically (verb + noun). Active voice.
- **Destructive actions include the object:** "Delete `project-alpha`" — user confirms the thing, not a generic verb. Typing the name for irreversible operations is the gold standard.
- **Action reveals consequence.** "Send invite" tells the user exactly what happens. "Submit form" does not.
- **One primary per view section** — solid for primary, outline/ghost for secondary.
- **Disabled states explain why** — not just grayed out, never rely on color alone.
- **One label per intent, page-wide.** "Get in touch", "Contact us", and "Let's talk" on the same page are one action wearing three names — each variant dilutes the conversion path. Pick one label per intent (contact, signup, view-work) and reuse it in nav, hero, and footer. Same for "Try free" / "Get started" / "Sign up free".
- **CTA labels fit one line at desktop.** A primary CTA that wraps to two lines is broken — shorten the label (≤3 words for primaries) or widen the button; never constrain a CTA's width artificially.
- **An action keeps its name through the whole flow.** The button that says "Publish" produces a toast that says "Published" — not "Success!" or "Your post is live". Confirmation dialogs, progress states, and completion messages all conjugate the same verb the trigger used. Interface vocabulary is signposting; renaming an action mid-flow makes the user re-verify they did the right thing.

---

## Numbers & Control Labels

- Numerals, never spelled out: "245", not "two hundred forty-five" — numerals have distinct shapes and scan faster. Group thousands ("12,400"); huge numbers go hybrid ("1 billion", "2.4M") so nobody counts zeros.
- Form labels drop possessives: "Email", not "My email" or "Your email" — the possessive adds a word and an ambiguity (whose?).
- Button labels are verb + noun ("Save post", "Delete message"): readable out of context, which is exactly how screen-reader users jumping between controls hear them.
- **Fake-precise numbers are a tell.** "92%", "4.1×", "13.4 lb" either come from real data (brief, brand, public metrics), are explicitly labeled as sample data, or get cut. Invented engineering precision the brand never claimed reads as fabricated the moment anyone checks.

---

## Copy Self-Audit (before any surface ships)

Re-read **every visible string** — headlines, eyebrows, button labels, body copy, captions, alt text, footer, error messages. Flag and rewrite anything that is:

- **Grammatically broken** or has an unclear referent ("we plan to stay that way" with no antecedent).
- **Forced cleverness** — wordplay that doesn't track, mock-poetic labels ("Field notes", "On our desks", "Loose plates" for a testimonials section), performative humility ("Quietly trusted by…"). Use the plain functional label: "Testimonials", "Trusted by", "Latest writing".
- **Generic step scaffolding** — "Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3", "Phase 01". The step's verb is the label: "Install", "Configure", "Ship".
- **Separator flooding** — ration the middle dot to one per metadata line ("foo · bar · baz · qux" is a tell; use line breaks or columns). Avoid the em-dash in UI strings (labels, buttons, captions) — restructure with a period, comma, or colon instead.

If a string might not make sense, replace it with a plain functional sentence. Boring copy beats broken-clever copy every time.

---

## Error Messages

Three parts, in order: **what happened** + **why** + **what to do**.

- "Upload failed. The file is 62MB; the limit is 50MB. Try compressing it or splitting into parts."
- "We couldn't reach the server. Your internet looks offline. We'll retry automatically when you're back online."
- "Can't create the project. The name `beta` is already taken in this workspace. Try another name."

**Missing pieces = bad error.** "Something went wrong" has none. "Invalid input" has only the first.

### Rules
- Explain what went wrong in plain language
- Suggest how to fix it
- Don't blame the user
- Include examples when helpful
- Link to help/support if applicable

**Bad**: "Error 403: Forbidden" → **Good**: "You don't have permission to view this page. Contact your admin for access."
**Bad**: "Invalid input" → **Good**: "Email addresses need an @ symbol. Try: name@example.com"

---

## Empty States

**Bad**: "No items" → **Good**: "No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."

- Explain why it's empty (if not obvious)
- Show next action clearly
- Make it welcoming, not a dead-end

---

## Loading & Success States

**Loading** — Bad: "Loading..." (for 30+ seconds). Good: "Analyzing your data... this usually takes 30-60 seconds."
- Set expectations, explain what's happening, show progress, offer "Cancel".

**Success** — Bad: "Success". Good: "Settings saved! Your changes will take effect immediately."
- Confirm what happened, explain what's next, be brief but complete.

---

## Confirmation Dialogs

**Bad**: "Are you sure?" → **Good**: "Delete 'Project Alpha'? This can't be undone."

- State the specific action
- Explain consequences (especially destructive)
- Clear button labels ("Delete project" not "Yes")
- Only for risky actions

---

## Form Labels & Microcopy

- Clear, specific labels (not generic placeholders)
- Placeholders are examples, not labels — labels exist separately, placeholders end with `…`
- Explain why you're asking (when not obvious)
- Instructions before the field, not after
- Never use placeholders as the only labels

**Tooltips** — Bad: "This is the username field". Good: "Choose a username. You can change this later in Settings."
- Add value (don't repeat the label), answer "What is this?" or "Why?", inline help first, tooltips as last resort.

---

## Formatting Rules

- **Ellipsis for loading/follow-ups**: "Loading…", "Rename…"
- **Use `…` character** not three dots `...`
- **Curly quotes**: " " not " "
- **Non-breaking spaces**: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`
- **Numerals for counts**: "8 deployments" not "eight deployments"
- **Active voice**: "Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed"
- **Default to positive language**: encourage, don't blame
- **`<title>` reflects current context**

---

## Content & States

Every UI must design for the full range of content and states, not just the happy path:

- **Design all states**: empty, sparse, dense, error, loading, success
- **Skeletons mirror final content** exactly — prevent layout shift
- **No dead ends** — always offer next step or recovery
- **Empty states** guide toward action, not just "nothing here"
- **Accessible names** exist even when visuals omit labels
- **Resilient to user-generated content**: short, average, very long

---

## Banned Patterns (Dark UX)

UX sins, not style choices.

- **Confirmshaming.** "No thanks, I don't care about security." Ship: "No thanks" as a plain link.
- **Fake urgency.** "Only 2 seats left!" when it's always 2. Ship: real counters or no counter.
- **Fake scarcity.** "87% of users upgraded" with no source. Ship: named, verifiable stats or omit.
- **Roach motel.** Easy signup, impossible cancellation. Ship: cancel in the same number of clicks as signup.
- **Dark toggles.** Opt-in checkboxes pre-checked for marketing emails. Ship: unchecked by default, unambiguous label.
- **Bait-and-switch pricing.** "$9/mo" that's actually "$9/mo, billed $108 annually, with a $29 setup fee." Ship: the total visible at decision time.

---

## Never

- Use jargon without explanation
- Blame users
- Be vague without specifics
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Use humor for errors (be empathetic)
- Assume technical knowledge
- Vary terminology (pick one term, stick with it)
- Repeat information (headers restating intros)
- Use placeholders as the only labels
- Exclamation points on errors
- Celebratory copy on routine saves
